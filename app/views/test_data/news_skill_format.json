In a new teaser for the Nov. 13 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians’ current season, the 36-year-old is seen making a game-changing admission, telling her mom, Kris Jenner, “I’ve come to the conclusion that I just want to explore surrogacy.” There’s only one thing that compares to the joy of welcoming a new Kardashian into the world, and that’s tracking the pregnancy—maternity look by maternity look.

On Saturday, Khloe and her sisters attended their mom's birthday party. The family rented out the Westlake Village Cinepolis (as they had previously, for Kim's birthday) for a private showing, and then migrated over the The Grill for a casual dinner.",
